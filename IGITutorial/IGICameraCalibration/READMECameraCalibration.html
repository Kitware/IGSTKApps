<h3>Camera Calibration</h3>
<p>
To enable the use of your computer's camera as a tracking device we
first need to calibrate it. The calibration process is straightforward
and only requires acquisition of several images.
</p>
<p>
To calibrate your camera you will need to follow the four step
process described below:
</p>
<ol type="I">
<li> <b>Preparation</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Print the calibration and validation patterns
(IGITutorial/Data/Calibration/*.pdf). <u>Make sure that the
square size in the validation pattern is 30mm</u>.</p>
</li>
<li> Attach both patterns to rigid planar surfaces. Two
sides of a hard cover book should do nicely. </li>
<li>
Disable auto-focus, if your camera has this feature. This is done using the camera control software that
came with your camera. If you don't know how to do this you will have to work at about the same distance from your camera at all times.
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li> <b>Image acquisition</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Press the "Start Camera" button (shortcut key: [s]) to
initialize the camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Position the calibration grid in front of the camera
and press the "Capture" button (shortcut key: [space]).</p>
<p> <u>Take five or more images</u> of the
calibration pattern in different orientations and positions. The more
images the more accurate the calibration. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> All images are saved to a temporary subdirectory
where the programs were installed (IGITutorial/Programs/tmp). You can
delete this directory after calibration. </p>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> <b>Camera calibration</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Press the "Calibrate" button (shortcut key: [c]). A
file selection dialog opens and you need to <u>select five or
more images</u>
of the calibration pattern. The pattern is detected in each of the
images and the result is displayed. If the pattern is successfully detected in enough
images then the camera is calibrated and the result is saved in a file
named "camera.uml" in a subdirectory where the tutorial was installed
(IGITutorial/Configuration).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> <b>Validation</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Position
validation grid in front of the camera and press "Validate" button
(shortcut key: [v]). If the validation pattern is detected in the
image, a popup window will open and the estimated distance between two
of the pattern's squares will be overlaid onto the image. <u>This
should be approximately 60mm.</u> If this varies significantly
from the expected value (>2mm) then the calibration is not accurate enough and
should be repeated. </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
Note that once you have images of the calibration pattern you can
calibrate the camera immediately after starting the program.
Similarly, once the camera is calibrated you can validate the
calibration without re-calibrating.
