<a name="calibrationProcess"></a><h3>Camera Calibration</h3>
<p>
To enable the use of your computer's camera as a tracking device we
first need to calibrate it. The calibration process is straightforward
and only requires acquisition of several images.
</p>
<p>
To calibrate your camera you will need to follow the four step
process described below:
</p>

<ol type="I">

<li> <b>Preparation</b>:
  <ol type="a">
     <li>
     <p>
     Print the calibration and validation patterns
     (IGITutorial/Data/Calibration/*.pdf). <u>Make sure that the square size in
     the validation pattern is 30mm</u>.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
     Attach both patterns to rigid planar surfaces. Two sides of a
     hard cover book should do nicely.
     </li>
   </ol>

</li><li> <b>Image acquisition</b>:
  <ol type="a">
     <li><p>Press the "Start Camera" button (shortcut key: [s]) to initialize the camera.</p></li>
  <li>
     <p>
     Position the calibration grid in front of the camera and press the
     "Capture" button (shortcut key: [space]).</p>
     <p>
     <u>Take five or more images</u> of the calibration pattern in
     different orientations and positions. The more images the more
     accurate the calibration.
     </p><p>
     </p><p>
     All images are saved to a temporary subdirectory where the
     programs were installed (IGITutorial/Programs/tmp). You can
     delete this directory after calibration.
    </p><p>

  </p></li></ol>
 </li>

<li> <b>Camera calibration</b>:
  <ol type="a">
    <li><p>Press the "Calibrate" button (shortcut key: [c]). A file selection dialog opens and you need to <u>select five or more images</u>
of the calibration pattern. The pattern is detected in each of the
images and the result is displayed in a popup window which is
automatically closed. If the pattern is successfully detected in enough
images then the camera is calibrated and the result is saved in a file
named "camera.uml" in a subdirectory where the tutorial was installed
(IGITutorial/Configuration).</p>
        </li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li> <b>Validation</b>:
  <ol type="a">
    <li><p> Position
validation grid in front of the camera and press "Validate" button
(shortcut key: [v]). If the validation pattern is detected in the
image, a popup window will open and the estimated distance between two
of the pattern's squares will be overlaid onto the image. <u>This should be approximately 60mm.</u> If this varies significantly from the expected value then the calibration is not accurate enough and should be repeated.
         </p>
        </li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>
Note that once you have images of the calibration pattern you can
calibrated the camera immediately after starting the program.
Similarly, once the camera is calibrated you can validate the
calibration without re-calibrating.
