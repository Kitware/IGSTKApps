<h3>Tracking Data</h3>
<p>This application acquires transformations for the user
selected markers and writes them to corresponding files. File names
have the following format "LogFile_IDxyz_n.txt", where "xyz" is the
marker number and "n" is the acquisition number. This counter is
incremented every time the user stops and starts a new acquisition
without exiting the program. Files are written to the IGIConfiguration
directory. Each line in the files has the following format:<br>
time x y z qx qy qz qs<br>
Where the first entry is a time stamp, the next three entries are the
translation, the following four entries represent rotation as a unit
quaternion. The first three entries are the vector part of the
quaternion and the last entry is its scalar part.
</p>
<font color="red">
<p>If a file already exists it will be overwritten.</p>
</font>
<p>To acquire tracking data you will need to follow the three
step process described below:
</p>
<ol type="I">
<li><b>Preparation</b>:
<p>If you haven't done so: </p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Perform camera calibration using the provided
application. </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Initialization</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Select the file containing your camera calibration
(usually IGITutorial/Configuration/camera.yml).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the markers you want to track.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press the "Initialize" button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, check that the camera can see the area
where you intend to work (popup window will close after a couple of
seconds).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Acquire data</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Press "Start" to start or continue transformation
acquisition. You have 5s before the acquisition starts.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press "Stop" to end transformation acquisition. If you
are dynamically acquiring data, that is the markers are undergoing
motion you will need to block the line of sight before pressing the
button so that you are not acquiring transformations for motion that is
not relevant for your study.</p>
