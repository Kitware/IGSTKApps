<a name="remoteProcess"></a><h3>Remote Control</h3>
<p>
This program allows you to control a power point presentation using your computer's webcam and
a set of markers. It is a toy example showing how a tracking device can be used as part
of a computer human interface.</p>

<ol type="I">
<li>
<b>Preparation</b>:
<p>
If you haven't done so:
</p>
  <ol type="a">
     <li>
     <p>
     Perform camera calibration using the provided application.
     </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>
     Print the tracked marker patterns
    (IGITutorial/Data/TrackedMarkers/markers.pdf), and separate the markers
    along the dashed lines. <u>Make sure that the internal, black, marker square size is 50mm</u>.</p></li><li><p>Cut them out and attach to a rigid planar surface. A standard index card is
    sufficiently rigid for our purposes.
     </p>
     </li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<b>Use the remote</b>:
  <ol type="a">
     <li>
     <p>
     Check that the camera can see the area where you intend to work, "Check Camera View". Popup window will close after a couple of seconds.
     </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>When the program is running and a marker is visible to the camera it
    will:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>marker 202: send a "Page Down" keystroke to the application that has focus.</li>
    <li>marker 502: send a "Page Up" keystroke to the application that has focus.</li>
    <li>marker 201: terminate the remote control program.</li>
    </ul>
     </li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>

<font color="red"><p>Remember to switch focus to the program you want to control. If the focus is on the "Remote Control" application nothing will happen.</p></font>
