<h3>Pivot Calibration</h3>
<p>
To enable tracking of the tip of a pointer tool we need to calibrate
it. The calibration process is straightforward and only requires
rotating the tool around a fixed, pivot, point. Any rigid pointer like
object can be used as a tool. We have found that a short hexagonal
pencil with a blunt tip is the simplest readily available pointer.
</p>
<p>
To calibrate the pointer tool you will need to follow the two step
process described below:
</p>
<ol type="I">
<li> <b>Preparation</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> If you haven't done so, perform camera calibration
using the provided application. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Print the tracked marker patterns
(IGITutorial/Data/TrackedMarkers/markers.pdf), and separate the markers
along the dashed lines. <u>Make sure that the internal, black,
marker square size is 50mm</u>.</p>
</li>
<li>Glue or tape one of the markers to the pointer tool
(this
is easy with a hexagonal pencil, not as much with a cylindrical one).</li>
<p> </p>
</ol>
</li>
<li> <b>Pivot Calibration</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Select the pointer tool's marker from the dropdown
menu (match the marker image or id number). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Select the number of transformations to acquire. Note
that the more transformations the more accurate the calibration but you
will have to pivot the pointer for a longer time (acquiring the default
number of transformations, 300, takes about 15s). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Press the "Initialize Tracker" button (shortcut key:
[i]). LED light will turn green, indicating success. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Position the pointer tool in the location where you
want to perform the calibration and make sure that it is visible by the
camera. Press the "Check Camera View" button (shortcut key: [c]). A
popup showing the camera view will be displayed. The window is
automatically closed after a few seconds. If the tracked marker was
visible in the central part of the previous image you can continue to
the next step, otherwise move the pointer to a new location and repeat
the process. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Press the "Calibrate" button (shortcut key: [space]).
You have 5s before data acquisition begins. Start pivoting the pointer
around the fixed point until data acquisition is completed. If the
calibration is successful the information is saved in a file named
"ToolTip.xml" in a subdirectory where the tutorial was installed
(IGITutorial/Configuration).</p>
