<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>
Prior to performing an image-guided navigation procedure some basic
setup and planning is required.
This program enables you to perform this task, generating a
configuration file which is then used by the navigation program. </p>
<p>
To generate the desired setup you will need to follow the four step
process described below:
</p>
<ol type="I">
<li> <b>Preparation</b>:
<p>If you haven't done so:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Perform camera calibration using the provided
application. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Perform pivot calibration using the provided
application. </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> <b>Data Specification</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Select the directory containing the CT data set which will be used for navigation.
We provide a data set of a LEGO phantom as part of the tutorial installation package [IGITutorial/Data/CT/Standard] and several others which can be downloaded from the tutorial web site (http://public.kitware.com/IGSTKWIKI/index.php/IGI_Tutorial)</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Select the file containing your camera calibration
(usually IGITutorial/Configuration/camera.yml).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Select the file containing your pointer tool
calibration (usually IGITutorial/Configuration/ToolTip.xml).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a file containing a 3D model representing your pointer tool. We
provide a default 3D representation, "IGITutorial/Data/MeshModels/ball.msh".</p>
</li>
<li>
Optionally modify how the CT is displayed using the Window/Level sliders (default is appropriate for our phantom).
</li>
<li>
<p> Move to the next tab (arrow button)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Tracker Setup</b>:
<p>In this tab you will specify the tracked markers and how
they should be
used in the navigation program. A marker can be used in one of three
ways: (1) Reference, this means that all measurements will be relative
to this marker. Often this is referred to as a Dynamic Reference
Frame/Base (DRF or DRB); (2) Pointer, this means that the pointer you
calibrated has this marker attached to it and that during navigation
the displayed images will be updated based on the location of the
pointer's tip; (3) Tool, additional tools which will also be tracked
and displayed in the 3D scene. After activating an additional tool a 3D
model will be required. </p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Select the markers associated with the reference and
pointer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Select any additional tools you want. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Move to the next tab (arrow button)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<b>Fiducial and Target Specification</b>:
<p>In this tab you will specify the fiducials (markers) which
later on you
will need to identify in the physical world (during the navigation
phase). <u>You need to specify three or more registration
fiducials</u>. You can also specify target points to which you
will be guided during the simulated intervention.
</p>
<p>
To pan an image, press the middle mouse button (or wheel) while moving.
To zoom in or out press the right mouse button while moving. To select
a point, press the left mouse button when the cursor is at the desired
location. Make sure that you can easily identify the fiducials you
select in the image in the physical world. </p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Press the "New Point Set" button or the "Load Point
Set" button if you want to modify an existing point set. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a desired point and press the "Add New Point"
button. If you
want to delete a point you need to select it in the "points tab" and
press the "Delete Point" button. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Repeat the point selection
process as desired (remember, if you are defining registration
fiducials you are required to provide at least three points). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Press the "Save Point Set"
button. If the points you have defined should be used as fiducials then
the "Registration points" checkbox should be checked, otherwise these
are target points. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Press the "Save
Configuration" button. The configuration file will be saved to
(IGITutorial/Configuration/IGIConfiguration.xml) </p>
</li>
</ol>
