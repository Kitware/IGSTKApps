<h3>3D Digitizer</h3>
<p>This application turns your off-the-shelf webcam into a low cost 3D scanner. Using a pointer like object the program allows you to obtain a 3D digital point cloud representation of a physical object. If you think you can digitize the region of interest without moving the object you can select the empty reference ID. If on the other hand you want to move the object (e.g. digitize a mug from all sides requires rotating it) you should attach a reference ID to it.
</p>
<p>
To digitize an object you will need to follow the three step process
described below:
</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>
<b>Preparation</b>:
<p>If you haven't done so:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Perform camera calibration using the provided
application. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Perform pivot calibration using the provided
application. </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<b>Initialization</b>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Select the file containing your camera calibration
(usually IGITutorial/Configuration/camera.yml).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Select the file containing your pointer tool
calibration (usually IGITutorial/Configuration/ToolTip.xml).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Select marker ID for the pointer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Select marker ID for the object reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Press the "Initialize" button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Optionally, check that the camera can see the area where you intend to work (popup window will close after a couple of seconds).
 </p>
 </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Scan</span>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> Press "Start" to start or continue point acquisition. You have 5s before the acquisition starts. Move the
pointer tool over the surface of the object and acquire the points. The LEDs indicate marker visibility.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Press "Stop" to end point acquisition. It is best to first rotate the pointer tool while it is still touching the object surface so that it is not visible to the camera. This way you do not acquire junk points before stopping the acquisition. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Press "Save As..." to write points to file. The result is a text file where each row is a single point's coordinates (x, y, z).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<font color="red">Some program specific quirks:</font>
<ul>
<li>The program does not display all of the points (see point no. vs. displayed).</li>
<li> Point cloud may not be visible on screen during acquisition. To see the cloud you will need to zoom out (press right mouse button while moving) or rotate (press left mouse button while moving). You can also pan the scene (press middle mouse button while moving).
</ul>
